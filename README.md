# Item Frame Dupe Assistance Addon

An addon for meteor designed to help with the item frame dupe, designed primarily for ~~openanarchy.org~~.
This mod automatically places item frames on pistons, so you will no longer need to place them manually.

Disabled on openanarchy, use is primarily for 6b6t now.

### How to use:  
- Download 'item-frame-dupe-0.4.jar' from [releases](https://github.com/Wide-Cat/item-frame-dupe-addon/releases)
- Put in mods folder along with the latest meteor dev build
- Make sure there are pistons in the set distance and that you have item frames in your hotbar or offhand.
